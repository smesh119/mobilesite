  <h1>Our culture</h1>
  <h2>Is Red Hat right for you?</h2>

  <p>When most companies talk about their culture and work environment, they describe what you would experience on their best days. We think it's more useful to know what you can expect from a typical day at Red Hat.</p></br>

  
  <div class = "purpose">> Purpose </div>
  <div class="section-purpose">
    <p>We are leaders in a movement that’s bigger than ourselves. We work to defend software freedom, connect people and ideas, and show the world the power of the open source way.</p></br>
    <img class="icon" src="http://smesh119.github.io/EVP/globe.jpg">
    <div class="text">It’s inspiring to work with people who believe in what they’re doing. To many Red Hatters, open source is a way to change the world for the better.</div></br>

    <div class="text">Being the open source leader is a huge responsibility. We compete against companies with many times more resources. People have the highest expectations of us, and we win by staying true to what we believe in.</div>
